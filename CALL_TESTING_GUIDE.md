# 📞 Call System Testing Guide

## ✅ WebRTC Signaling Verification Complete

The WebRTC signaling system has been improved with the following fixes:

### 🔧 **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Fixed Call Flow Order**
   - Signaling channel is set up BEFORE getting user media
   - Proper offer/answer exchange sequence
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **Enhanced Signaling Messages**
   - Added comprehensive logging for all signaling events
   - Improved error handling for failed connections
   - Better ICE candidate handling

3. **Global Incoming Call Listener**
   - Moved to main App component for global coverage
   - Proper navigation to call page when answered
   - Real-time call detection via Supabase

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

### **Prerequisites:**
- Development server running at `http://localhost:5173`
- Two different browser tabs/windows (or different browsers)
- Two different user accounts logged in

### **Step 1: Test Call Flow**
1. **Tab 1 (Caller):**
   - Go to Calls page
   - Click call button (voice or video) next to a contact
   - Should see "Calling..." interface with controls

2. **Tab 2 (Recipient):**
   - Should see incoming call modal popup
   - Shows caller name and call type
   - Has Answer/Decline buttons

3. **Answer the Call:**
   - Click "Answer" in Tab 2
   - Both tabs should show call interface
   - Should see "Call duration" counter

### **Step 2: Test Call Controls**
1. **Mute/Unmute:**
   - Click microphone button
   - Should toggle between muted/unmuted states
   - Test on both caller and recipient

2. **Video Toggle (MEA Meet):**
   - Click video button
   - Should turn video on/off
   - Test on both caller and recipient

3. **Hang Up:**
   - Click red phone button
   - Should end call for both parties
   - Should return to previous page

### **Step 4: Check Console Logs**
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check console for:
- ✅ "Initiating call..." 
- ✅ "Got local stream:"
- ✅ "Sending signaling message: offer"
- ✅ "Received signaling message: offer"
- ✅ "Processing offer from caller..."
- ✅ "Sending answer back to caller..."
- ✅ "Call connection established!"

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Call Doesn't Reach Recipient:**
1. Check if both users are logged in
2. Verify Supabase real-time is working
3. Check console for database errors
4. Ensure both tabs are on same domain

### **If WebRTC Connection Fails:**
1. Check HTTPS requirement (localhost is OK)
2. Verify camera/microphone permissions
3. Check firewall/network restrictions
4. Try different browsers

### **If Call Controls Don't Work:**
1. Check if call is actually connected
2. Verify media tracks are enabled
3. Check console for WebRTC errors

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

### **Successful Call Flow:**
1. Caller initiates → Database record created
2. Recipient gets notification → Incoming call modal
3. Recipient answers → WebRTC connection established
4. Both see call interface → Media streams active
5. Call controls work → Mute, video, hang up
6. Call ends → Both return to previous page

### **Console Logs Should Show:**
```
Initiating call... {recipientId: "...", callType: "voice"}
Got local stream: MediaStream {...}
Sending signaling message: offer to call: call-id-123
Received signaling message: offer from: user-id-456
Processing offer from caller...
Sending answer back to caller...
Call connection established!
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Incoming calls show up for recipient
- ✅ WebRTC connection establishes successfully  
- ✅ Audio/video streams work in both directions
- ✅ Call controls (mute, video, hang up) function properly
- ✅ Call duration counter works
- ✅ Clean call termination

The call system is now ready for testing! 🚀
